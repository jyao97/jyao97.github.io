description: "Trajectory planning is foundational for achieving many higher-level objectives in robotics. However, current solutions often fall short in providing safe and robust trajectory generation in dynamic and realistic human-interactive scenarios. This project aims to advance towards the goal of enabling safe, efficient, and socially-aware robot navigation by leveraging reinforcement learning, uncertainty management, and other advanced techniques."
